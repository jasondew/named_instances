= Named Instances

Provides support for named instances in Rails.

Quick usage:

  class Diagnosis < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_named_instances :name
  end

  >> Diagnosis.get(:diabetes_mellitus)
  => #<Diagnosis id: 52, name: "Diabetes Mellitus", created_at: "2009-10-07 15:41:50", updated_at: "2009-10-07 15:41:50">

Patches welcome, enjoy!
